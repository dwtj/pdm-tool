\section{pdm-tool}

pdm-tool is a program that, given a list of tasks, their durations, and
their dependencies, computes the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Early Start (ES)
    \item Early Finish (EF)
    \item Late Start (LS)
    \item Late Finish (LF)
    \item Critical Path
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Input Validation}

pdm-tool enforces the following input constraints (and \textit{only} the
following input constraints):

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Task duration must be a non-negative integer
    \item A Task predecessor must appear in the input stream before its
          successor
    \item Tasks must not have depndecy cycles
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Algorithm}

pdm-tool makes two passes: a forward pass to calculate EF and ES, and a
backward pass to compute LF and LS. The critical path is then found by
identifying tasks in which ES = LS and EF = LF.
